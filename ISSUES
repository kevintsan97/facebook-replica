# Fixed issues
    1. "getStylesCreator.js:28 Uncaught TypeError: theme.spacing is not a function"
        - Occur mostly when 'redirect' to "/posts" but works fine if enter directly or refresh
        - Click on home icon to return home seems to cause the same error
        ==>> SOLVED!!

    4. First click on the post won't load the details but refresh again then it works
        - Same as number 1. 
        ==>> SOLVED!!
    
    5. Divider and Grid of material-ui are the problems!!
        ==>>SOLVED!!
        ==>> Same problem for all 3 -> Fix theme.spacing

    2. Sign in button does not align in mobile view
        2b. Navbar in mobile view (RESOLVED WHEN NOT LOGIN)
        2c. Same issue when login in with name, avaar and logout btn
        ==>> RESOLVED AS WELL
        
    3. Filtering by memory 'tags' and 'titles' 's logic not complete
        - 3a. Unable to filter with the combination of both
        - 3b. If not enter anything should just return every posts
        ==>> 3b is RESOLVED!
        ==>> 3a right now the logic is inclusive - Tags, Title, Message -> OR operation - Can change to AND if need exclusive amongst the three
