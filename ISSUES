# Fixed issues
    1. "getStylesCreator.js:28 Uncaught TypeError: theme.spacing is not a function"
        - Occur mostly when 'redirect' to "/posts" but works fine if enter directly or refresh
        - Click on home icon to return home seems to cause the same error
        ==>> SOLVED!!

    4. First click on the post won't load the details but refresh again then it works
        - Same as number 1.
