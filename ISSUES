# All issues
    1. "getStylesCreator.js:28 Uncaught TypeError: theme.spacing is not a function"
        - Occur mostly when 'redirect' to "/posts" but works fine if enter directly or refresh
        - Click on home icon to return home seems to cause the same error

    2. Sign in button does not align in mobile view

    3. Filtering by memory 'tags' and 'titles' 's logic not complete
        - Unable to filter with the combination of both
        - If not enter anything should just return every posts

    4. First click on the post won't load the details but refresh again then it works
        - Seems to work now July 3, 2023
    
    5. Divider and Grid of material-ui are the problems!!
